<h2><a id="THE_CROP_TO_HARVEST_FOR_SEED"></a>THE CROP TO HARVEST FOR SEED.</h2>


<p>White sweet clover and biennial yellow sweet clover are harvested
for seed the year following seeding. In localities where those species
will produce two cuttings the second year, either the first or the
second crop may be harvested for seed. As the plants die when
mature, only one cutting will be obtained if the first crop is permitted
to ripen. It is becoming a general practice in many sections of the
country to utilize the first crop of the second season for pasture,
ensilage, or hay, and the second crop for seed. As a rule, this is the
most profitable and economical way to handle sweet clover, as the
first crop will produce an abundance of nutritious pasturage or from
6 to 10 tons of ensilage or 1 to 3 tons of hay to the acre. The second
crop seldom grows more than 4 feet high when the first crop is pastured
or cut. The shorter growth of the second crop is a very desirable
feature, as it may be cut with a grain binder without difficulty.
When the first crop of white sweet clover is permitted to mature, the
plants often make so large a growth that it is very difficult to handle
them with ordinary farm machinery. This trouble is experienced
more often in humid regions than in semiarid sections.</p>

<p>As biennial yellow sweet clover seldom grows as tall as the white
species, little difficulty is experienced in cutting the first crop of the
second year for seed with a grain binder. Annual yellow sweet
clover, or sour clover, is seldom grown for seed, as a sufficient quantity
to supply the market is obtained from the screenings of wheat
grown in the Southwest.</p>

<p>Sweet-clover seed ripens irregularly and shatters badly when
mature. On this account much seed is lost before and during
harvest, and ordinary harvesting machinery has not been entirely
satisfactory for handling the crop.</p>

<h2><a name="TIME_TO_CUT_THE_SEED_CROP" id="TIME_TO_CUT_THE_SEED_CROP">TIME TO CUT THE SEED CROP.</a></h2>


<p>Opinions of extensive growers of sweet clover differ as to the
proper stage at which to cut the seed crop. Some believe that it
should be cut when the pods on the lower branches have turned
dark brown to black, while others maintain that it is best to wait
until the seed on the upper portions of the plants is mature. The
time of cutting the seed crop should be governed largely by the
machinery which is to be used. If the plants are to be harvested
with a self-rake reaper or a grain binder, they should be cut when
approximately three-fourths of the seed pods have turned dark
brown to black. At this time some flowers and many immature
pods will be found on the plants, but the field will have a brownish
cast. If the crop is not cut until the seed pods on the uppermost
branches have matured, most of the pods on the lower branches will
have shattered.</p>

<p>It is the practice in regions where a grain header is employed to
permit the plants to become somewhat more mature before cutting
the seed crop than in sections where other machines are used. More
seed is shattered when the plants are cut at the latter stage, but this
is not necessarily a loss, as the grain header is employed for the most
part in semiarid regions, where the shattered seed is depended upon
to reseed the land.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="LOSS_OF_SEED_FROM_SHATTERING" id="LOSS_OF_SEED_FROM_SHATTERING">LOSS OF SEED FROM SHATTERING.</a></h2>


<p>From one-fifth to three-fourths of the total seed yield of sweet
clover is lost from shattering. The percentage of the loss which
occurs before harvesting will depend largely on the time the crop is
cut. Much seed may be lost if harvesting is delayed for only a few
days, and many fields have been observed in which at least 90 per
cent of the seed had shattered in less then two weeks after the time
the plants should have been cut.</p>

<p>The percentage of seed which is lost in harvesting will depend
largely upon the manner of handling the crop. The binder or
header may be equipped at a small cost, so that much of the seed
which ordinarily is lost while cutting may be saved. Much shattered
seed will be saved by using wagons with tight platforms or platforms
covered with canvas. All unnecessary handling should be avoided.</p>

<p>Shattering may be reduced to a minimum by cutting the plants
when they are damp from rain or dew. It is the practice in some
regions to cut in the early morning or late evening, but this procedure
will apply only to small acreages, since it is necessary to cut
the crop as soon as possible when it reaches the proper stage for harvesting.
It is a good practice to cut sweet clover at night, as the
plants usually are damp at that time.</p>

<h2><a name="MACHINERY_USED_FOR_HARVESTING_THE_SEED_CROP" id="MACHINERY_USED_FOR_HARVESTING_THE_SEED_CROP">MACHINERY USED FOR HARVESTING THE SEED CROP.</a></h2>


<p>No machine thus far manufactured has given entire satisfaction
for cutting the sweet-clover seed crop. On account of the ease
with which the pods shatter, it is a question whether any machine
can be devised which will handle this crop without the loss of some
seed. It is possible and practicable, however, for farmers at a small
cost to equip their binders with pans and guards, so as to save most
of the seed which otherwise would be lost.</p>


<h3>THE ORDINARY MOWER.</h3>

<p>The ordinary mowing machine is one of the most unsatisfactory
devices used for harvesting this crop, as the subsequent handling
necessary to place the plants in windrows or cocks causes much of the
seed to shatter. The use of this machine for this purpose should be
avoided whenever possible.</p>


<h3>THE SELF-RAKE REAPER.</h3>

<p>The self-rake reaper is one of the most efficient machines employed
to cut sweet clover for seed. (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1.</a>) This machine deposits the
newly cut plants with the tops all turned one way in gavels or bunches
at the side, so that the horses do not trample them on the next round.
A high stubble also may be left, thereby reducing the weight and
bulk of the plants which must be hauled to the thrashing machine.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;A sled used
 in western Kansas for hauling sweet clover from the field to the thrashing machine.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is the custom in some localities to leave the gavels to cure
as dropped by the reaper on the ground, while in other sections they
are placed in cocks that weigh about 300 pounds each when cured.
If the gavels are to be placed in cocks, this should be done immediately
after cutting, as the plants will be somewhat green and tough at this
time and fewer pods will shatter than when the plants are permitted
to dry before handling. When the crop is to be hauled to the thrashing
machine on wagons it is best to permit the gavels to cure as
dropped by the reaper, as it will then be possible to pitch them on
the wagon with a large 4-tined fork. If the crop is to be hauled to
the thrashing machine on large sleds, which is the practice in western
Kansas, less seed will be lost from shattering if the gavels at the time
of cutting are placed in cocks of such a size that they may be put
on the sleds entire by two men lifting from opposite sides of the cock
with 4-tined forks. The sleds used for this purpose usually are 12
by 20 foot in size, made of matched flooring and with 6 to 12 inch sides.
(<a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2.</a>) Matched or tight floors are necessary, so that all seed which
shatters may be saved. These would not be so essential, however,
if the sleds were covered with a tarpaulin or canvas. From the
standpoint of saving shattered seed, this method of hauling the crop
from the field to the thrashing machine is possibly the most economical
thus far used. It is estimated that at times as much as one-third
of the seed yield is collected from the floors of the sleds. It
would be a good plan to replace the runners of the sleds with very
low trucks, as this would lighten the draft considerably.</p>

<p>When sweet clover is cut with a self-rake reaper the crop is thrashed
directly from the field. From 7 to 10 days of good haying weather
in sufficient to cure the plants in the gavel or cock. Thrashing should
be done as soon as possible, much seed is shattered by rains and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span>
winds. While a self-rake reaper is used to some extent in different
sections of the country, it is used most extensively in the western
North-Central States, and especially in western Kansas.</p>


<h3>THE GRAIN BINDER.</h3>

<p>A grain binder is employed extensively for cutting the sweet-clover
seed crop. (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3.</a>) The general use of this machine in many sections
of the country is due to the fact that it is found on most farms
and therefore causes no outlay of money, rather than because of its
efficient work. It is not so efficient as the self-rake reaper unless it is
equipped with pans and guards to save the seed which shatters.</p>

<div id="Fig_3" class="fig_center" style="width: 436px;">
<img src="images/fig3.png" width="436" height="299" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Cutting
 sweet clover for seed with a grain binder.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is possible to equip the grain binder with pans and extensions to
the rear elevator plate and binder deck, so that at least 95 per cent of
the seed which shatters when the crop is cut may be saved. Those
pans and extensions may be made out of ordinary galvanized metal
and strap iron. The galvanized metal may be purchased at any tin
shop or hardware store, and if sufficient strips of iron can not be
found around the farm for this purpose strap iron may be purchased
at any blacksmith shop. The material for those pans and extensions
should not cost more than $4.50 or $5, and it should be possible to
have them made complete for $8 or $10, including material. Unless
there are a forge and drill on the farm it will be necessary to have the
braces and supports for the pans made at a blacksmith shop. The
strap iron used in connection with the pans may vary in size, but for
the most part it need not be heavier than one-eighth inch in thickness,
and seven-eighths inch in width. The supports for the pan under the
binder deck preferably should be one-quarter inch thick, as this pan
will have much more strain on it than the pans under the elevators.
Where bolts are to be used, ordinary stove bolts will suffice.</p>

</div>

<p>The plans for making the pan which should be placed under the
opening between the platform and the lower elevator are illustrated
in <a href="#Fig_4">figure 4</a>. The material to be used for this pan should be cut to
conform to the size and shape shown in <a href="#Fig_4">figure 4, <i>A</i></a>; the sides should
then be bent upright along the dotted lines, so that the pan will be
18 inches wide at the top. One end, which should be solid, may be
made so by bending the center portion upright and then bending the
sides against it. The side and center pieces should be riveted together.
(<a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4, <i>C</i>.</a>) Any suitable door which will prevent seed from
falling out of the pan will suffice for the other end. A door is highly
desirable, so that the seed may be removed more easily when the pan
is full. A convenient type is shown in <a href="#Fig_4">figure 4, <i>E</i></a>. A top view of the
pan when completed is given in <a href="#Fig_4">figure 4, <i>B</i></a>. It will be necessary to
brace the pan, and this may be done by riveting strips of strap iron,
preferably one-eighth inch thick and one-half inch wide, on the outer
edges of the sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span></p>

<p>This pan is held in position by two supports made of strap iron,
preferably seven-eighths inch wide and one-eighth inch thick, which
have been bent to conform to the outside of a cross section of the
pan. (Figs. <a href="#Fig_4">4, <i>C</i></a>, and <a href="#Fig_5">5, <i>B</i></a>.) The ends of these supports which fasten
under the platform should be bent to a sharp angle and the tip of each
slightly flattened, so that they may be pushed between the angle bar
at the end of the platform and the bottom of the platform. The
other end of each support should have a hole drilled in it, so that it
may be bolted to the stirrups, which should be made to hook over the
inside sill. (Figs. <a href="#Fig_4">4, <i>C</i></a>, and <a href="#Fig_5">5</a>.) These supports should be placed
about 6 inches from the ends of the pan and riveted or bolted to
it. This will serve to brace the pan and to hold it in place. The
pan may be attached to the machine by hooking the supports over the
angle iron on the bottom of the platform and by bolting them to the

<p>The pan to be placed under the deck of the machine will serve to
collect the seed which is shattered on the deck and the extension to
the deck. The plans for making this pan are shown in detail in <a href="#Fig_6">figure 6</a>.
The material should be cut along the solid lines and of the
size designated in <a href="#Fig_6">figure 6, <i>A</i></a>. The sides of the pan should be bent
upward on the dotted lines, so that the pan will be 24 inches wide at
the top. The ends should then be made in the manner described for
the pan which is placed under the opening of the platform and lower
elevator. A door may be put in the rear end of this pan if desired; but
this is not necessary, as no trouble will be experienced in removing the
seed. <a href="#Fig_6">Figure 6, <i>B</i></a>, gives a top view of the pan when completed and also
a portion, of the guard which serves to direct into this pan the seed
which shatters on the deck. This guard is shown in detail in
<a href="#Fig_7">figure 7</a>. As this pan is larger and
heavier than that placed under the
lower elevator, not only should it
have strips of iron riveted to the
outer edges of the sides, but two
cross braces also should be employed. Those may be fastened to
the strips of iron supporting the
sides of the pan and should be
about 12 inches from the ends of
it. This pan is supported by two
strips of strap iron bent to conform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span>
to the outside of a cross section of it and hook over the binder
pipe under the deck and bolt to stirrups placed on the outer sill of
the frame. Each support may be made from one strip of strap iron.
It may be necessary to bend the ends of the supports which hook over
the binder pipe in opposite directions. Both ends of the supports
which hook over the binder pipe may hook outward, as shown in <a href="#Fig_7">figure 7, <i>C</i></a>,
or the rear support may hook inward, as illustrated in <a href="#Fig_5">figure 5</a>.
It is not absolutely necessary that those supports of the pan
hook in opposite directions on the binder pipe, yet when this is done
it will make the pan more rigid. The pan may be attached by first
hooking the supports over the binder pipe underneath the deck and
then bolting the other end of the supports to the stirrups on the outer
sill. The pan should be fastened to the supports. A cross section
of this pan, the supports for it, and the stirrups which hook over the
sill are shown in <a href="#Fig_7">figure 7, <i>C</i></a>.</p>

<p>If this pan extends beyond the deck so that the seed which is shattered
on the deck will drop directly into it, the bundles when released
from the packers will strike the pan. For this reason it is necessary
to place a guard at the end of the deck, so that the seed which falls
on the deck will be directed into the pan. This guard, as shown in
figures <a href="#Fig_5">5</a> and <a href="#Fig_7">7</a>, consists of a piece of galvanized metal, to the upper
side of which has been riveted a strip of iron. The upper side of this
guard should be bent slightly inward at the lower edge of the strip of
iron and placed in such a position that it will be approximately 1&frac12;
inches beyond the lower end of the binder deck and extend from 1 to
1&frac12; inches above the deck. If it is placed at right angles to the deck
and no higher than 1&frac12; inches above it, it will not interfere with the
bundles as they are released from the packers. This guard should
be supported by two angles of strap iron, as shown in <a href="#Fig_7">figure 7, <i>D</i></a>.
Those braces are bolted to the supports of the pan, and the guard is
bolted to the braces. As this guard should extend a little below the
supports of the pan, so as to prevent the wind from blowing the seed
over it, it is necessary to cut slots in the guard so it will fit over the
supports. The ends of this guard should be rolled slightly inward,
so that the seed falling close to them will be directed into the pan.
When the extension to the binder deck is placed in the proper position,
the seed collected by it will be directed against the guard and
then into the pan below.</p>

<p>The extension to the elevator should be bolted to the rear elevator
plate. This extension should be so wide that the tops of the plants
will not reach beyond it. The details for this extension are shown
in <a href="#Fig_8">figure 8</a>. The outer edge and lower end of this extension should
be bent upward and slightly inward, so that the seed which falls upon
it will be directed to the opening between the platform and lower
elevator, where it will fall into the pan beneath. The curved edge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span>
the lower part of this extension should be flattened as much as possible,
so that it will not interfere with the upper portions of the plants
as they pass from the platform to the elevators. The opening must be
sufficiently large, however, to permit small branches and racemos
which fall upon the extension to pass into the pan. The angle of the
lower portion of it must be large enough to permit the seed to run
directly into the pan below. If this portion is sloped from the seat
pipe to the opening between the platform and the lower elevator no
trouble will be experienced. This extension may be bolted to the
machine by drilling
holes in it to coincide with those in the
elevator plate.</p>

</div>

<p>It is necessary to
widen the binder
deck, so as to save
the seed which is
shattered from those
portions of the plants
which extend beyond
it. This may be done
by bolting to the rear
end of this deck an
extension, as shown
in detail in <a href="#Fig_9">figure 9</a>.
This extension may
be made from one
piece of galvanized
iron, which should be
cut along the solid
lines and of the size
shown in <a href="#Fig_9">figure 9, <i>A</i></a>.
It should be bent
upward and slightly inward at the dotted lines shown in this
figure. The extended strips, as shown in <a href="#Fig_9">figure 9, <i>B</i></a>, should be
riveted to the main part of the extension. When this is done a
trough will be formed along the side and lower end of it, so that all
seed which shatters upon it will be directed into the pan below the
deck. The object in riveting the extended strips at the end of the
extension to the main part is to prevent the tops of the plants from
catching in the trough when the bundles leave the packers. It may
be necessary to fasten a brace to the bottom of the deck to support
this extension. This can be done, however, by using a strip of
strap iron or wood. The upper end of this extension should be bent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span>
to fit under the upper end of the one attached to the elevator plate,
so that the plants will not be hindered in passing from one to the
other. Both extensions may be braced strongly at the top by
fastening them to a right angle of iron or wood.</p>

<p>A grain, binder equipped with the pans and extensions herein outlined
is shown in <a href="#Fig_10">figure 10</a>.</p>

<p>Binders equipped in the manner described have been tested carefully
in different sections and have proved beyond doubt that they
offer an economical device for harvesting sweet clover for seed.
This equipment has been used most extensively in Livingston County,
Ill., where farmers have saved with it from $6 to $10 worth of seed
per acre. When this
equipment is used the
plants may be permitted to become somewhat more mature before cutting, as the
seed which is shattered will be saved by
the pans.</p>

</div>

<p>As the pans and
extensions described
have been designed
for one type of binder,
it may be necessary
to modify them
slightly for use on
other types of machines. Before making a set of these pans
and extensions for
any machine, the
plans shown should be compared carefully with the binder to be
equipped, in order that any changes which will need to be made may
be noted. The pans and extensions at least maybe made on the farm,
and then it will be an easy matter to check up the measurements for
the supports, which may be made at a blacksmith shop.</p>

<p>Difficulty may be experienced in cutting sweet clover with a
binder when the first crop has been permitted to mature, as the
plants may be so tall that the machine will not handle them properly.
This difficulty may be overcome entirely in most sections of the
country by pasturing the field until the first part of June or by cutting
the first crop for hay. It is recommended that the stubble be left
as high as possible when cutting sweet clover for seed. Not only
will this greatly facilitate harvesting but it will leave many of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span>
woody, unpalatable portions of the plants on the ground, where they
will decay quickly, and help to increase the humus content of the
soil. (See the <a href="#titlepg">illustration</a> on the title-page.)</p>

<p>When the seed crop is cut with a binder it is best to shock the
bundles as soon as possible, so as to avoid unnecessary shattering.
Conditions should determine whether the bundles be placed in long
narrow shocks or in round shocks. The plants will cure somewhat
faster in long narrow shocks, and this form should be preferred when
grasshoppers are not troublesome. Sweet-clover shocks should not
be capped, as capping will cause some seed pods to shatter.</p>

<h3>THE GRAIN HEADER.</h3>

<p>Grain headers have been used successfully for harvesting the sweet-clover
seed crop in several sections of the United States, especially in
western Kansas. The principal advantages in using this machine
are that a larger acreage may be cut in a given time than with either
a grain binder or a self-rake reaper and that a high stubble may be
left. The greater acreage which may be cut with a header is important
when large acreages are to be harvested, as much seed is lost by
shattering if the crop is not cut at the proper stage for harvesting,
while the high stubble which may be left when cutting the seed crop
with a grain header is a decided advantage, as it not only reduces
greatly the weight and bulb of the plants which must be thrashed,
but it also leaves the hard, woody portions on the ground, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
they will decay and be of some value as a fertilizer. It is best to
remove only those portions of the plants which contain sufficient
seed to thrash, but this is not always possible, even with a header,
unless the field contains a fairly thin stand and the plants are not
more than 4&frac12; to 5 feet high. When the seed crop is to be cut with
a grain header, it usually is permitted to stand somewhat longer than
when other machines are used.</p>

<p>A tin pan or some other receptacle should be placed at the lower
end of the header elevator in order to save the seed which otherwise
would be lost at that place.</p>

<p>The plants are carried into header wagons or barges in the same
way as grain. When a heavy crop is cut it will be necessary to have
two men in the barge to handle the plants. The floor of the header
wagon should be made perfectly tight, or it should be covered with a
canvas or tarpaulin, so as to save the seed pods which shatter.</p>

<p>When the crop is cut at the proper stage it may be placed directly
in stacks or ricks without danger of heating or molding, provided the
ricks are covered or topped with some material which will shed water
and are built upon a foundation, so that air may circulate under
them. Native grass or green sweet-clover plants of the first year's
crop will serve very nicely for topping the stacks.</p>

<p>It is the custom of some people to place the barge loads close
together in individual stacks so located that they may be hauled
quickly and easily to the thrashing machine. On other farms
enough barge loads are placed together to make a rick approximately
10 by 10 by 40 feet in size. When each barge load is placed
in a separate stack it is necessary to load the plants again, so as to
haul them to the thrashing machine. The shattering of seed pods
and the extra labor caused by reloading and by hauling the plants
may be avoided for the most part by placing the crop in ricks large
enough for a day's thrashing. It is good practice to place such ricks
in pairs sufficiently close together for both to be pitched directly to
the feeder of the machine. When this method is employed two days'
thrashing may be done without moving the machine.</p>

<p>The header binder, consisting of an attachment placed upon the
header to bind the cut plants, has been used successfully in cutting
the sweet-clover seed crop.</p>


<h3>THE CORN HARVESTER.</h3>

<p>Corn harvesters are proving to be efficient machines for cutting
sweet clover which has made a growth too large to be cut with a
grain binder. Even when the field has been seeded broadcast a
3-foot swath may be cut with the corn harvester, provided the
gathering or divider points are extended to collect the plants. This
may be done by fastening to each point a piece of wood or iron about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span>
18 inches long. When a corn binder is used no more seed is lost
from shattering than when an ordinary grain harvester is employed,
unless the later is equipped with special pans and extensions, for
the reason, primarily, that the portions of the plants which produce
most of the seed extend above the gathering or divider boards and
are not crushed. When a 5-foot or larger growth is cut with a corn
binder, the plants are tied below the seed-bearing branches.</p>

<p>In the semiarid sections of the country a limited quantity of sweet
clover is planted in rows for both forage and seed production. In
such a case the seed may be harvested with a corn binder. (<a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11.</a>)</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>&mdash;A stack of
 sweet clover.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Much discussion has taken place among extensive growers of sweet
clover as to the advisability of stacking the seed crop after it is cut
with a grain binder or a corn harvester. The conditions present in
each case should determine the proper course to pursue. If it will
be impossible to thrash within 10 days after cutting, much less seed
will be lost by stacking two or three days after cutting than by permitting
the plants to remain in the field subject to possible rains.
In such cases it is urged that the crop be stacked, as the seed saved
by this operation, if the handling is done with care, will much more
than pay for the labor. When it is possible to thrash in a week or
10 days after cutting, the crop should be thrashed directly from the
field, as little seed ordinarily will be lost during this time and the
work of stacking will be avoided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span></p>

<p>When the crop is to be stacked, the stacks should be built in the
same way as stacks of grain; and when properly built they will shed
water as well as grain stacks. (<a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12.</a>) It is well, however, to provide
a covering, and if canvas is not available a top-dressing of green
grain or young sweet-clover plants will suffice. Sweet clover should
remain in the stack for three or four weeks, as it will require about that
time for the plants to pass through the sweat. A stack should always
be placed on high ground, where water will not collect about the base,
and it is recommended that a foundation of some kind be provided,
so that air may circulate beneath. A few
posts or rails will answer this purpose very well.</p>

<h2><a name="THRASHING_THE_SWEET-CLOVER_SEED_CROP" id="THRASHING_THE_SWEET-CLOVER_SEED_CROP">THRASHING THE SWEET-CLOVER SEED CROP.</a></h2>


<p>Two methods are in
general use for thrashing the sweet-clover
seed crop. The seed may be flailed from
the plants, or it may be removed by a grain
separator or a clover huller.</p>


<h3>FLAILING THE SEED.</h3>

<p>Much of the sweet-clover seed harvested
in the South is flailed
from the plants. This
method is necessarily
slow and does not hull
the seed. It is practicable, therefore, only in regions where the necessary
machinery for hulling the seed crop is not available or where the
acreage to be thrashed is very limited. One advantage of thrashing
the seed in this manner is that the straw is left in the field, where it
will add much organic matter to the soil.</p>

<p>When the seed is to be flailed, the crop ordinarily is cut with a
scythe or mowing machine and the plants raked into piles or windrows.
If only small areas are to be harvested in this manner, a canvas
or tarpaulin may be spread on the ground beside a windrow or
pile and several forkfuls of sweet clover pitched on the canvas, where
the seed may be removed from the plants by striking them a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span>
times with flails, sticks, or forks. After the plants have been struck
a few times they should be turned over and struck again. When the
seed is removed front the plants, the straw may be pitched to one
side, the canvas placed beside another portion of the windrow or by
another pile, and the operation repeated. It is not necessary to remove
the seed from the canvas until its weight or bulk interferes with
moving the canvas.</p>

<p>It is the practice in some sections of the country to place a well-braced
frame, covered with wire netting, on a sled and to flail the
seed on this frame. The netting used for covering the frame should
have meshes 1 inch or loss in diameter. The sled should be at least
7 feet wide and 10 feet long and should have sides and ends approximately
12 inches high. Smaller sleds sometimes are used, but a larger
one is to be preferred if two or more persons are to flail on it at one
time. If the floor of the sled is not perfectly tight, it should be covered
with canvas and the edges of the canvas thrown over the sides
and ends of the sled, so as to avoid losing any of the seed and to facilitate
its removal. A sled so equipped may be drawn from pile to pile,
the plants pitched on it, the seed flailed from them, and the straw
returned to the land for soil improvement.</p>

<p>Another method, very similar to that just described, is to place a
frame on a hayrack. The frame should be built sufficiently strong
and in such a manner that the person who is to do the flailing may
stand on it. It should be covered preferably with galvanized-wire
netting having half-inch meshes, and if this is stretched tightly it
will serve to strengthen the frame. If it is not practicable to make
the hayrack perfectly tight, it should be covered with a tarpaulin or
canvas. A wagon so equipped may be pulled from pile to pile or
along the windrows, where one person may pitch the plants upon the
frame, to be flailed by one or more persons standing on it. After the
seed is removed from the plants, the straw may be scattered easily
and quickly over the ground for soil improvement.</p>

<p>Flailed seed should be cleaned thoroughly with sieves and fanning
mills to remove the inert matter and immature pods before it is sown
or offered for sale on the market. It is recommended that whenever
possible unhulled seed be run through a clover huller to hull the seed
or through an Ames hulling and scarifying machine to remove the
hulls and to scarify the seed. By this process the outer coat of the
seed is scratched or broken. The scarifying increases the percentage
of germination by facilitating the entrance of moisture.</p>

 sweet clover with a grain separator. Note the large sleds used for handling
 the plants from the field to the thrashing machine.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>THE GRAIN SEPARATOR.</h3>

<p>A grain separator (<a href="#Fig_13">fig. 13</a>) is used more than any other machine
for thrashing sweet clover. This is because more grain separators
than clover hullers are found in localities where sweet clover is
grown and because the ordinary clover huller will not handle a large
growth of sweet clover satisfactorily. When the grain separator is
operated carefully no trouble should be experienced in removing the
seed from the plants, but it is necessary to make certain adjustments
if the seed is to be hulled. The adjustments required will vary
somewhat with the make of machine and the dryness of the crop.
The riddles should be adjusted or changed so they will handle sweet-clover
seed properly. Alfalfa or red-clover riddles will answer this
purpose. The speed of the fan should be decreased, so the seed will
not be blown over, and this usually will be accomplished when the
speed is reduced to about one-half that used in thrashing grain.
The number of rows of concave teeth which should be used will vary
with the dryness of the plants and somewhat with their size. When
it is not desired to hull the seed, one or two rows of concave teeth
will be sufficient. Some operators believe that one or two rows are
sufficient to hull 40 to 50 per cent of the seed when the plants are
very dry. Those are exceptional cases, and hulled seed should not
be expected unless more rows of concave teeth are used. If hulled
seed is desired it is recommended that a full set be used and that
these be set to run closer to the cylinder teeth than is customary
when thrashing grain. Some operators replace two rows of the
smooth, concave teeth with corrugated teeth. This practice is
recommended wherever possible, as the corrugated teeth will facilitate
greatly the hulling of the seed. Even where these changes are
made, only a small percentage of the seed will be hulled if the pods
are damp. If the plants have been permitted to make a very large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span>
growth the machine may clog unless the number of rows of concave
teeth is reduced. Clogging may be overcome for the most part by
feeding the bundles to the machine slowly. This precaution is necessary
regardless of the size of the plants if the seed is to be removed
properly and hulled. It is possible to hull from 90 to 95 per cent of
the seed when the proper adjustments are made and the plants are
dry.</p>

<p>A clover-hulling attachment, which consists for the most part of
special sieves and a number of rows of corrugated concave teeth
which replace the ordinary concave teeth, has been used with success
in different sections of the country.</p>


<h3>THE CLOVER HULLER.</h3>

<p>As a rule, ordinary clover hullers do not handle sweet clover very
satisfactorily. Machines with cylinders larger than those commonly
used are giving fair satisfaction provided the plants do not make a
large growth, but even these machines have not been so successful as
properly adjusted and equipped grain separators. A clover huller
will handle a 2 to 3 foot growth of sweet clover if the rows of thrashing
concaves are reduced and the plants are fed slowly to the machine.
It will not hull sweet clover as well as red clover, and it is very doubtful
whether it will hull more seed than a grain separator equipped
with a hulling attachment.</p>

<p>The manufacturer of at least one clover huller has designed special
rasps for the hulling cylinder and concaves of his machine, and these
rasps do better work than the ones ordinarily used for hulling red
clover.</p>

<p>It is the custom in some localities to run the sweet clover through a
thrashing machine without adjusting the concaves and then to
run the unhulled seed as delivered by the grain separator through a
clover huller. A fair quality of seed may be obtained by this process,
but it calls for much extra labor and time, and for this reason should
be avoided Whenever possible.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="YIELDS_OF_SWEET-CLOVER_SEED" id="YIELDS_OF_SWEET-CLOVER_SEED">YIELDS OF SWEET-CLOVER SEED.</a></h2>


<p>Many factors besides shattering influence the yield of sweet-clover
seed. As only those portions of the plants exposed directly to the
sunlight set seed abundantly, thin stands usually produce more seed
to the acre than heavy stands. When very heavy stands make a
large growth, seed is produced only on the upper 24 to 30 inches of
the plants, whereas with thinner stands it is produced on the lower
branches as well.</p>

<p>The quantity of moisture in the soil at the time the seed is maturing
is an important factor also. During hot, dry weather the plants
may not be able to absorb from the soil sufficient water to supply the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span>
excess required by them for seed production. In this event many
of the seed pods will abort and fall when partly mature. Pods
abort and fall in a very short time, so that partly shriveled ones
seldom are found on the plants, although the extent of the aborting
is shown by the number of barren racemos. When such weather
conditions prevail, the second crop usually will produce a heavier
yield than the first crop. This is due for the most part to the inability
of the large plants to obtain sufficient water for seed production.
The much smaller plants of the second crop do not require as much
moisture as the larger plants of the first crop, as the vegetative growth
is seldom more than half as much.</p>

<p>The type of root growth has much to do with the quantity of water
the plants are able to obtain during droughty weather. When
sweet clover is planted on soil that has a tendency to be wet, the
plants will produce a much-branched shallow root system instead of
the normal deep roots which are found on well-drained soils. During
dry weather the upper layers of soil become so depleted that plants
having a very large percentage of their roots in these layers can not
obtain a sufficient quantity of moisture to supply their requirements
for seed production.</p>

<p>It is often stated that the first crop of sweet clover will produce
more seed to the acre than the second crop. This depends very
largely upon the thickness of the stand and on weather conditions.
In regions where two crops may be grown in a season, the first usually
will produce more seed to the acre than the second if the field has a
thin stand. When the stand is thick the second crop ordinarily
yields more seed. In regions where a crop of hay or pasturage may
be obtained in addition to the seed crop, it is seldom an economical
procedure to permit the first crop to mature. Not only will sweet
clover produce an abundance of nutritious pasturage or a cutting of
1 to 3 tons of hay in addition to the seed, but the difficulty of handling
the large, stemmy growth of the first crop for seed is avoided.</p>

<p>Yields of sweet-clover seed have been reduced during the last two
seasons by several fungous diseases. Experimental work has not
been completed to show the percentage of damage done by these
organisms, but in some sections of the country seed yields were
reduced considerably. The clover stem borer,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> which is prevalent in
red clover in certain sections of the country, also infests sweet clover.
It is probable that this insect did some damage to the seed crop in
certain sections of the country in 1916.</p>

<p>The yield of sweet-clover seed varies from 2 to 10 bushels of re-cleaned
seed per acre.</p>

<h2><a name="SWEET-CLOVER_STRAW" id="SWEET-CLOVER_STRAW">SWEET-CLOVER STRAW.</a></h2>


<p>Sweet-clover straw may be utilized for soil improvement or as a
roughage for stock. When it is not needed for feeding it should be
turned under, as it will add much humus and nitrogen to the soil.
When the seed is flailed from the plants the straw may be easily and
quickly spread over the land at the time of flailing, but when the
crop is thrashed with a grain separator or a clover huller it will be
necessary to haul the straw and scatter it over the field. When the
crop is thrashed in this manner the straw will be broken and crushed
so that stock will eat it freely. The straw may be run directly from
the thrashing machine into the silo, where, by adding sufficient
water, it can be made into good silage. <a href="#Table_I">Table I</a> gives the analyses
of nine samples of sweet-clover straw which were collected in Illinois
in the fall of 1916.</p>
